/**
 * This random hands approach is inferior to the <code>ogrebattle.tarot.exact</code> approach that finds
 * exact odds to back up the calculations given below that the simulation here merely converges to.<br>
 * The exception where simulation is useful is for drawing more than 7 cards in one setting, such as many Joker pulls,
 * that brute-forcing becomes impractical.<br>
 * In such a case, adjust <code>public static final int CARDS_DRAWN = 7;</code> in TarotDeck.java and
 * <code>setup()</code> in TarotDeckArray.java, if using that class<br>
 * @param args the number of hands to draw, default to 1 million if no args passed<br>
 * <br>
 * EXACT ODDS:<br>
 * <br>The subtraction of occurrences in the 1 AND (1 of X) calculations is necessary to remove<br>
 * double-counted occurrences, as it were. Odds here with the hypergeometric distribution are<br>
 * generally easier to calculate than with combinatorics. With more complex hands, such as in<br>
 * poker, combinatorics is the most practical approach for exact odds.<br>
