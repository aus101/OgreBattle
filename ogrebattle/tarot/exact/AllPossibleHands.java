/**
 * Generate all possible Tarot card combinations from 1 to 7 cards drawn out of the 22 card deck.<br>
 * Choose the number of cards with <code>handSize</code> and set true to <code>doNotSort</code>
 * to have the hands in random order versus sorted. Can generate random hands even if sorted.<br><br>
 * COMBIN(22,6) = 74613 possible sets of Tarot questions by Warren and COMBIN(22,7) = 170544. Let's brute force these hands into existence.<br>
 * Takes less than 1 second on a stock i5 desktop for non-sorted and less than 3 seconds for sorted for hand of 6
 * and less than 2 seconds and 5 seconds respectively for sorted hand size of 7.<br><br>
 * Sorting is unnecessary for generating random hands or calculating exact odds but intelligent contains calls would be faster,
 * i.e. only the first 20349 hands contain Magician and hand 35853 is the last with a Priestess.<br>
 * The order for sets of hands would be deterministic for a HashSet due to bucket hashing even though the hands generate in random order.<br><br>
 * Each hand is itself sorted so must be shuffled for where order does matter such as final Tarot card bonus.<br>
 * Could just as well choose a random card in the set as the final card.<br>
 * Replacing TreeSet for LinkedHashSet would also work but no approach yields all permutations where order for every card matters.<br>
 * Is 22*21*20*19*18*17 = 53,721,360 permutations versus easily brute forced 74613 combinations with 6 cards where order does not matter.<br>
